   <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my friends, my Chinese name is Zhi Wang, you can call my English name Steven, I am an international student from China. I am now studying interactive Media Design Program in Algonquin College. My hobbies are swimming, photography, and staring blankly.
    </p>
    <p>Before I came to Canada, I worked as an interior designer, a driver, and a UI designer. Among them, UI design is my favorite job, and I really like the process of transforming concepts into practical presentations. Therefore, I choose to continue my study here to improve my design ability.
