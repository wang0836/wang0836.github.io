# Portfolio Description
I am going to talk about the process of this Portfolio.

About this Portfolio coding itself. I learned a lot when I finished this code, and I would go to w3school when I encounter tags that I don't understand, such as <span>, is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. At the same time, I keep trying and learning bootstrap. Bootstrap can greatly save Framework's time. For example, using Grid's presets.

Compared with the accuracy of the code, I pay more attention to the connection between front-end code and UI design. For example, when doing UI design, I will consider Framework, reduce fancy design, and consider more maintenance of design and development, such as referring to the Framework style of bootstrap.

Overall although coding is hard, the fun of coding is learning and rewarding. Whenever I understand or solve a problem, the joy of harvesting is my motivation to keep learning.
